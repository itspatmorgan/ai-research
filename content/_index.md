## ðŸ“– Overview

Welcome to the companion repository for the Unknown Arts newsletter! 

This repo documents my exploration into the world of Artificial Intelligence, with a focus on learning, experimentation, and sharing insights with the community.

I'm actively working on this project, so expect a variety of content, including:

### Now
- Markdown files summarizing key concepts and findings
- Links to useful resources
- My daily blog of learning and experimentation

### Future
- Jupyter Notebooks with tutorials, code examples, and projects
- Scripts and other Python files for more focused coding exercises

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

This project runs in Hugo, a static site generator, uses the [Hextra theme](https://github.com/imfing/hextra), and is hosted on GitHub Pages.

The main content is in the `content` folder:

- **/blog:** Markdown files with my daily blog of learning and experimentation
- **/docs:** The home of all project documentation, organized by category
- **/docs/guides:** Links to useful resources & my notes on them
- **/docs/patterns:** Prompting patterns for AI tools like ChatGPT & Claude

This will evolve over time.
