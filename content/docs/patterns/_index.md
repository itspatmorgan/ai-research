This directory contains a collection of AI prompt patterns tailored to creative professionals. Each file offers guidance on using a specific pattern to enhance your interactions with AI, enabling you to automate tasks, refine ideas, and explore new creative approaches.

## Overview

These patterns are based on recent research into AI prompt engineering, focusing on practical applications for modern creatives â€” writers, designers, marketers, entrepreneurs, etc.... By leveraging these patterns, you can bring more structure and creativity to your AI-powered projects.

## Patterns Available

### Input Semantics
- [Meta Language Creation]({{< relref "/docs/patterns/meta-language-creation" >}}): Develop a custom shorthand language for efficient AI interactions.
