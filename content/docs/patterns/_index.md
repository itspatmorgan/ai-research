## Overview

Prompt Patterns offers a curated collection of AI interaction strategies for creative professionals. 

Based on recent prompt engineering research, these patterns provide practical guidance for writers, designers, marketers, entrepreneurs, and more to enhance their AI-powered projects. 

By applying these techniques, you can automate tasks, refine ideas, and explore innovative approaches, bringing structure and creativity to your AI interactions.

## Patterns Available

### Input Semantics
